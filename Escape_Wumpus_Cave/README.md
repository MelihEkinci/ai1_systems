Assignment 1.5
================


This repository contains the problems for assignment 1.5 along with example problems and example solutions.


#### `verify.py`
You can use `verify.py` to check your solutions (both the for the example maps as well as for the actual maps).
It will send them to a server and print out some feedback.
It requires the `requests` package (`python3 -m pip install requests`).
Then you can run the script with:
```
python3 verify.py path/to/maps path/to/your/solutions
```
