## FAUhalma Game Agent

This assignment focuses on implementing an agent for the FAUhalma game, a variant of Sternhalma/Chinese checkers. The agent competes on a server, aiming to move its pegs into the opposite corner (home) as quickly as possible. The solution utilizes the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to determine the best moves for the agent.

For detailed information and instructions on running the FAUhalma Game Agent, please refer to the [FAUhalma Game Agent README](FAUhalma/README.md).

## Find the Best Train Connection

The objective of this assignment is to find the best train connections between two places in India using different cost functions. The project involves working with graphs, solving a large real dataset search problem, implementing efficient algorithms, understanding the impact of cost functions on search algorithms, and handling CSV file formats.

For detailed information and instructions on running the Train Connection Finder, please refer to the [Find the Best Train Connection README](TrainConnection/README.md).

## Escape the Wumpus Cave

This assignment challenges students to navigate an agent out of a treacherous Wumpus world using Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planning. The project emphasizes the understanding of PDDL, encoding of planning problems, and the utilization of planners to find solutions.

For detailed information and instructions on running the Escape the Wumpus Cave solution, please refer to the [Escape the Wumpus Cave README](EscapeWumpusCave/README.md).

## Clean the Wumpus Cave

The goal of this assignment is to navigate a vacuum cleaner robot through the Wumpus cave, efficiently cleaning the area through a series of instructions. The project focuses on the application of agents in AI search within a simulated environment, requiring the development of optimal instruction sequences for cleaning the cave.

For detailed information and instructions on running the Clean the Wumpus Cave solution, please refer to the [Clean the Wumpus Cave README](CleanWumpusCave/README.md).
